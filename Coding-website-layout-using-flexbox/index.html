                <p>I am an aspiring <span>web/app developer</span>. Although, my main passion is in writing. I also have a certification in hardware maintenance.</p>

                <p>I was born in Chicago, IL and raised in Oak Park, a Chicago suburb. I like read, travel, and write on my spare time. I can remember some of the places I traveled to with my family, and most of those places were picked out by my mother, who actually had pretty decent taste in vacation spots.</p>

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>I already mentioned writing as a hobby, but for me, it is also a passion of mine. In fact, would put it right up there next to web/app development. I really feel like with writing and web/app development I can express my own creativity and, also, make a living off of it, hopefully someday soon.</p>

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p>A fun fact: As a born Chicagoan, I'm pretty used to the cold. Although, that doesn't that I, in any way, enjoy the cold. To be honest I would much rather be living in a much warmer climate, preferably one where it never snows. Rain I can handle, but snow, no, I've had quite enough of that.</p>
